## Offering a calendar subscription

With the [Add to Calendar Button](https://github.com/add2cal/add-to-calendar-button), you can also offer your users the option to subscribe to a calendar, instead of only saving static events.

To get this to work, you would simply need to set the public address (an .ics file) of the calendar as the "icsFile" option and set the "subscribe" option to true.

This repository holds a demo ics files.
